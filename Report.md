# Python Projects Report

## Introduction
This project encompasses a series of weekly Python assignments aimed at enhancing algorithmic thinking and mathematical programming skills.

## Weekly Breakdown
- **Weeks 1-5:** Basic arithmetic and number theory functions such as factorial, palindrome, and digit operations.
- **Weeks 6-8:** Emphasis on prime-related algorithms, modular arithmetic, and probabilistic primality tests.

## Key Algorithms and Concepts Implemented
- Factorials and digit-based computations
- Prime factorization and prime number tests
- Harshad, abundant, deficient, automorphic, and pronic number checks
- Modular exponentiation, multiplicative inverse, Chinese Remainder Theorem
- Miller-Rabin primality test, Pollard's rho factorization algorithm

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x programming language
- Standard Python libraries for math and time measurement

## Conclusion
The project strengthened both theoretical and practical knowledge in computational number theory and prepared for more advanced algorithmic challenges.
